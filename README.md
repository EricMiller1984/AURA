AURA: Anomalous and Unexplained – Research and Analysis
Definition: A set of tools for the collection, organization and analysis of unexplained events, beings, people and locations.

Project Outline

In the various unique areas of paranormal research, there are common relationships to other areas of research. The goal of this software application, is to allow the investigator to determine those related commonalities to be visualized, interpreted and analyzed. Using neural networks to suggest common patterns in various unexplained phenomena, or Anomalies.

The problem we have today in the paranormal and unexplained realm, is that in my opinion, there is no collaboration between subject matter.

On one side, you have investigators researching only specific areas. For example, UFO’s and aliens, haunted places and objects, cryptids, myths and legends, the spiritual realms/occult sciences, conspiracies and secret societies, science (time-travel, anti-gravity, etc).
